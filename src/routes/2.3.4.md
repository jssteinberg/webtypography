<p>When setting verse, whether on the web or otherwise, the primary concern is not to deprive it of its “chosen form”, including matters of spacing and visual structure <span class='bracket'>(</span>as this is considered, in many poetic works, to be at least as important as the words themselves<span class='bracket'>)</span>. As such, a <code>pre</code> <span class='bracket'>(</span>pre-formatted<span class='bracket'>)</span> element is most apt to setting&nbsp;verse.</p>

```html
<blockquote class="verse">
<pre>God guard me from those thoughts men think
In the mind alone;
He that sings a lasting song
Thinks in a marrow bone.</pre>
</blockquote>
```

<p>In its default state the <code>pre</code> element is usually rendered using a monospaced font, so this should normally be changed to a more fitting typeface. Setting the <code>font-family</code> to inherit the typeface from the surrounding text may be a good&nbsp;start:</p>

```css
.verse pre {
  font-family: inherit;
}
```

<p>A logical way to center the verse on the longest line would be to simply specify <code>width:auto</code> and <code>margin:0 auto</code>. Unfortunately, due to browsers’ rendering of preformatted elements, the element will still be considered to comprise full-width lines, so no centering will occur. However we can work around this by specifying the <code>pre</code> element to display as a <code>table</code> as&nbsp;follows:</p>

```css
.verse pre {
  font-family: inherit;
  display: table;
  width: auto;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

<p>The preceding rules achieve the desired layout in Firefox, Safari and Opera 9. However <code>margin:0 auto</code> will not center elements in Internet Explorer 6&nbsp;or 7, without a specific width being set. To work around this, a new <code>span</code> element containing the entire block of verse must be nested within the <code>pre</code> element as&nbsp;follows:</p>

```html
<blockquote class="verse">
<pre><span>God guard me from those thoughts men think
In the mind alone;
He that sings a lasting song
Thinks in a marrow bone.</span></pre>
</blockquote>
```

<p>This <code>span</code> can then be centered in Internet Explorer applying  <code>text-align:center</code> to the <code>pre</code> and resetting the text alignment on the <code>span</code>&nbsp;element.</p>

```css
.verse pre {
  text-align: center;
}

.verse pre span {
  text-align: left;
}
```

<p>Much like other browsers, Internet Explorer considers any preformatted content to have full-width lines; to counter this, the <code>span</code> can be set to <code>display:inline-block</code>. This in turn causes Internet Explorer to ignore white-space formatting, so we must re-set the <code>span</code> to <code>white-space:pre</code>. This gives&nbsp;us:</p>

```css
.verse pre {
  text-align: center;
}

.verse pre span {
  text-align: left;
  display: inline-block;
  white-space: pre;
}
```

<p>The <code>display:inline-block</code> in the preceding rule causes Gecko-based browsers such as Firefox and Camino to incorrectly render the contents. Fortunately these rules are only required for Internet Explorer, so we can write them in a separate style sheet, included using conditional comments <span class='bracket'>(</span>see <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html" title="Quirksmode: &#013;Conditional comments">Quirksmode</a> for more&nbsp;info<span class='bracket'>)</span>:</p>

```html
<!-[if lte IE 7]>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ie-lte-7.css" />
<![endif]->
```

<p>Here’s the final rendered example of prose, set flush left &#38; ragged right, and centered on the longest&nbsp;line:</p>

<div class="example"><blockquote class="ex2-3-4"><pre><span>God guard me from those thoughts men think
In the mind alone;
He that sings a lasting song
Thinks in a marrow bone.</span></pre></blockquote></div>
